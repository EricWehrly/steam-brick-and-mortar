### Current Priority Tasks

#### Task 4.3.1.1: ⭐ **CURRENT PRIORITY** - Integrate Steam API client into TypeScript WebXR application
**Status**: 🚧 **READY TO START**
**Description**: Create Steam API integration in the WebXR client to fetch and display user's game library
**Expected deliverable**: 
- Create Steam API client class in TypeScript
- Add API endpoint configuration for deployed infrastructure
- Implement vanity URL resolution in WebXR app
- Add game library fetching functionality
- Test integration with SpiteMonger account in browser

**Prerequisites**: ✅ All met
- Steam API infrastructure deployed and tested
- WebXR 3D scene foundation complete (Milestone 3)
- TypeScript build system working
- CORS properly configured for browser access

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Create `SteamApiClient` class in `client/src/steam/`
2. Add configuration for `https://steam-api-dev.wehrly.com`
3. Implement methods: `resolveVanityUrl()`, `getUserGames()`
4. Add error handling and loading states
5. Test with SpiteMonger account in browser
6. Integrate with existing 3D scene (populate game boxes)

#### Task 4.3.1.2: 📋 **NEXT** - Add Steam account input/authentication UI
**Status**: 📋 **WAITING**
**Description**: Create UI elements for users to input their Steam vanity URL
**Expected deliverable**: 
- Steam vanity URL input field
- Loading states during API calls
- Error handling for invalid accounts
- Success state showing resolved Steam ID

### Background Context

#### Previous Major Milestones ✅
- **Milestone 1**: Project infrastructure and Docker setup ✅
- **Milestone 2**: Blender procedural shelf generation ✅
- **Milestone 3**: 3D scene foundation with shelf and game boxes ✅
- **Milestone 4.1**: AWS serverless infrastructure deployment ✅
- **Milestone 4.2**: Steam API integration testing ✅

#### Key Files & Directories
- `client/`: TypeScript WebXR application with Vite build system
- `scripts/test-steam-api-live.sh`: Validated Steam API testing script
- `external-tool/infrastructure/`: Deployed AWS Lambda infrastructure
- `blender/gen_shelf_modular.py`: Working 3D asset generation
- `docs/roadmap.md`: Updated roadmap with current progress

#### Current Technical Stack
- **WebXR + Three.js**: 3D scene foundation complete
- **AWS Lambda + API Gateway**: Steam API proxy deployed and tested
- **TypeScript + Vite**: Client build system working
- **Steam Web API**: Full workflow validated with real account

## Task Completion Workflow

### How to Approach Current Task (4.3.1.1)
1. **Navigate to client directory** and ensure build system works
2. **Create Steam API client structure** (`client/src/steam/`)
3. **Implement API calls** using deployed infrastructure
4. **Test with browser** using SpiteMonger account
5. **Integrate with 3D scene** to populate game boxes with real data
6. **Update documentation** and commit working changes

### Testing Strategy
- Use `yarn serve` for development server
- Test Steam API calls in browser console first
- Use `scripts/test-steam-api-live.sh` to verify infrastructure
- Test with real Steam account (SpiteMonger) for validation

### Success Criteria for 4.3.1.1
- [ ] Steam API client class created and working
- [ ] Can resolve "SpiteMonger" vanity URL in browser
- [ ] Can fetch 810 games from SpiteMonger's library
- [ ] Error handling works for invalid accounts
- [ ] Integration ready for UI and 3D scene population

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Test Steam API infrastructure
cd scripts && ./test-steam-api-live.sh

# Start WebXR client development
cd client && yarn serve

# Build and test client
cd client && yarn build && yarn test

# Generate fresh 3D assets
docker compose run blender blender --background --python blender/gen_shelf_modular.py
```

**Remember**: Infrastructure is verified and working. Focus on client integration with confidence that the backend is solid!
