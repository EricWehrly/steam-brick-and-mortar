- Offline data availability checking and seamless fallback modes
- Cache insights with detailed statistics showing usage, size, and data age

**UI Enhancements**:
- Cache management controls integrated into Steam account panel
- Refresh Cache button (green) for forced data updates from Steam API
- Clear Cache button (red) for complete cache reset and storage cleanup
- Cache Info button (blue) showing detailed statistics and storage information
- Use Offline button automatically appears when cached data is available
- Real-time cache status updates and visual feedback during all operations

**Technical Achievements**:
- Smart caching: Automatic cache/retrieve with configurable expiration times
- Offline support: Full functionality without internet when data is cached
- Performance optimization: Dramatically reduced API calls for repeated requests
- Storage efficiency: Intelligent key management and automatic cleanup processes
- User control: Manual refresh and clear cache options for power users
- Cache insights: Detailed statistics showing cache usage, size, and data age
- Error resilience: Automatic recovery from corrupted cache data

### Current Priority Tasks

#### Task 4.3.1.4: ‚≠ê **CURRENT PRIORITY** - Handle API errors gracefully in WebXR interface
**Status**: üöß **READY TO START**
**Description**: Enhanced error handling and recovery throughout the WebXR interface
**Expected deliverable**: 
- Enhanced error handling for network failures and API downtime
- Graceful degradation when Steam API is temporarily unavailable
- User-friendly error messages with suggested recovery actions
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Connection status indicators in the WebXR interface
- Enhanced offline mode transitions and notifications

**Prerequisites**: ‚úÖ All met
- Steam API client working and tested with caching

5. Test complete user workflow
6. Connect to 3D scene population with real game data

#### Task 4.3.1.3: üìã **NEXT** - Cache game library data for offline use
**Status**: üìã **WAITING**
**Description**: Implement local storage and caching for Steam game library data
**Expected deliverable**: 
- Browser localStorage integration
- Cache invalidation strategy
- Offline mode capability
- Performance optimization for large libraries

## Task Completion Workflow

### How to Approach Current Task (4.3.1.2)
1. **Review existing Steam API client** (`client/src/steam/SteamApiClient.ts`)
2. **Design UI components** for Steam account input and feedback
3. **Implement HTML form elements** in WebXR overlay or scene
4. **Add event handlers** connecting UI to Steam API client
5. **Test complete user workflow** with real Steam accounts
6. **Integrate with 3D scene** to populate game data

### Testing Strategy
- Use `yarn test` for running test suite (now without watch mode)
- Use `yarn serve` for development server
- Test Steam API integration in browser with DevTools
- Use `scripts/test-steam-api-live.sh` if infrastructure verification needed
- Test with real Steam account (SpiteMonger) for validation

### Success Criteria for 4.3.1.2
- [ ] Steam account input UI created and styled
- [ ] Loading states implemented for API calls
- [ ] Error handling UI for invalid/missing accounts
- [ ] Success feedback showing resolved Steam ID and game count
- [ ] Complete user workflow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Ready for 3D scene integration with real Steam data

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Run all tests (now without watch mode)
cd client && yarn test

# Start WebXR client development
cd client && yarn serve

# Build and test client
cd client && yarn build

# Test Steam API infrastructure (if needed)
cd scripts && ./test-steam-api-live.sh

# Generate fresh 3D assets
docker compose run blender blender --background --python blender/gen_shelf_modular.py
```

**Remember**: Steam API client is working and tested! Focus on creating an intuitive UI for users to input their Steam accounts and see their game libraries in the 3D scene.
