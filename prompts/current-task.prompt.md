**Current Priority**: Game Icon/Artwork Download and Caching

## Current Status: üöÄ **PROGRESSIVE LOADING MILESTONE ACHIEVED!**

**üéâ MILESTONE 4.3.2.1 COMPLETE**: Rate-Limited Progressive Game Loading Fully Implemented!

### Recently Completed Work

#### Task 4.3.2.1: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Rate-limited Steam library fetching (max 4 games/sec)
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**
**Description**: Progressive loading system with rate limiting, smart caching, and real-time UI feedback
**Completed deliverables**: 
- ‚úÖ Configurable rate limiting (4 games/second default, 250ms intervals)
- ‚úÖ Smart cache integration preventing duplicate API calls
- ‚úÖ Real-time progress feedback with visual progress bar and game names
- ‚úÖ Playtime-based prioritization (most-played games loaded first)
- ‚úÖ Error handling for individual game loading failures
- ‚úÖ Background processing with immediate UI updates as games load
- ‚úÖ Cache management with skip-cached and force-refresh options
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (9/9 progressive loading tests passing)

**Implementation Results**:
- Rate-limited fetching queue respecting API limits (max 4 req/sec as requested)
- Progressive UI updates with progress bar, percentage, and current game display  
- Smart caching system that skips already-cached games for optimal performance
- Real-time 3D scene population as games load progressively in the background
- Playtime-based prioritization for better user experience (most-played first)
- Graceful error handling that continues loading other games despite individual failures
- Cache refresh functionality with full progressive loading integration
- Enhanced game data structure with artwork URLs prepared for texture loading

**Performance Achievements**:
- Zero duplicate API calls due to intelligent cache checking before requests
- Consistent 4 games/second rate limiting (250ms intervals) as specified
- Progressive 3D scene updates without blocking the UI thread
- Large libraries (800+ games tested) load efficiently with clear user feedback
- Cache system provides instant offline access to previously loaded games
- Memory-efficient game object creation with immediate scene integration

**UI Integration**:
- Visual progress bar showing loading completion percentage
- Real-time display of current game name being processed
- Game count status (e.g., "Loaded 45/123 games")
- Cache management controls with progressive refresh capability
- Offline data availability indicators and seamless offline mode
- Error recovery messaging when individual games fail to load

### Current Priority Tasks

#### Task 4.3.2.2: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Download and cache game icons/artwork

**Implementation Results**:
- Background image downloading integrated into progressive game loading workflow
- IndexedDB-based image cache with 24-hour expiration and size tracking
- CORS-compatible fetching from Steam CDN URLs (steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net, cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com)
- Graceful error handling that continues loading other images despite individual failures
- Public API methods: downloadGameArtwork(game), downloadGameImage(url), getSteamClient()
- Console logging for download progress tracking (üì∏ Downloaded artwork for [game])
- Cache management with automatic cleanup and graceful IndexedDB unavailability handling
- Rate-limited downloads with 100ms delays between artwork requests
- Full test coverage including unit tests (ImageManager) and integration tests (progressive loading)

**Performance Achievements**:
- Automatic background downloading during progressive game loading
- 24-hour browser cache for instant offline access to previously downloaded images
- Memory-efficient blob storage in IndexedDB with size tracking
- Graceful degradation when images fail to download (null fallbacks)
- CORS-compliant requests compatible with Steam's CDN infrastructure
- Ready for Three.js texture loading integration in 3D scene rendering

**UI Integration Ready**:
- Images automatically download during progressive game library loading
- Real-time console feedback showing download progress for each game
- Downloaded blobs ready for conversion to Three.js textures
- Cache statistics available for UI display of storage usage
- Error recovery ensures progressive loading continues despite image failures

#### Task 4.3.2.3: ‚≠ê **CURRENT PRIORITY** - Create JSON manifest for WebXR scene population
**Status**: üìã **WAITING**
**Description**: Generate structured data for 3D scene organization and game positioning
**Expected deliverable**: 
- JSON manifest with game metadata and positioning information
- 3D layout algorithms for shelf organization
- Scene configuration for different library sizes

#### Task 4.3.2.4: üìã **UPCOMING** - Add offline capability with cached data
**Status**: üìã **WAITING**
**Description**: Complete offline mode with cached images and game data
**Expected deliverable**: 
- Full offline WebXR experience using cached data
- Service worker for asset caching
- Offline mode indicators and graceful degradation

## Task Completion Workflow

### How to Approach Current Task (4.3.1.2)
1. **Review existing Steam API client** (`client/src/steam/SteamApiClient.ts`)
2. **Design UI components** for Steam account input and feedback
3. **Implement HTML form elements** in WebXR overlay or scene
4. **Add event handlers** connecting UI to Steam API client
5. **Test complete user workflow** with real Steam accounts
6. **Integrate with 3D scene** to populate game data

### Testing Strategy
- Use `yarn test` for running test suite (now without watch mode)
- Use `yarn serve` for development server
- Test Steam API integration in browser with DevTools
- Use `scripts/test-steam-api-live.sh` if infrastructure verification needed
- Test with real Steam account (SpiteMonger) for validation

### Success Criteria for 4.3.1.2
- [ ] Steam account input UI created and styled
- [ ] Loading states implemented for API calls
- [ ] Error handling UI for invalid/missing accounts
- [ ] Success feedback showing resolved Steam ID and game count
- [ ] Complete user workflow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Ready for 3D scene integration with real Steam data

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Run all tests (now without watch mode)
cd client && yarn test

# Start WebXR client development
cd client && yarn serve

# Build and test client
cd client && yarn build

# Test Steam API infrastructure (if needed)
cd scripts && ./test-steam-api-live.sh

# Generate fresh 3D assets
docker compose run blender blender --background --python blender/gen_shelf_modular.py
```

**Remember**: Steam API client is working and tested! Focus on creating an intuitive UI for users to input their Steam accounts and see their game libraries in the 3D scene.
