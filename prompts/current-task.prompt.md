### How to Approach Tasks
1. **Read this prompt file completely** to understand current context
2. **Review the roadmap** (`docs/roadmap.md`) for the bigger picture
3. **Focus on the specific current task** outlined below
4. **Work incrementally** - each task should be completable in one session
5. **Test as you go** - validate each change immediately
6. **Update both this prompt and the roadmap** when tasks are completed

### Development Guidelines
- **Use Docker containers** whenever possible for reproducible builds
- **CLI-first approach** - everything should work via command line
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Windows primary, but consider others
- **Commit small, working changes** - don't break the build
- **Document what you learn** - update relevant docs as you discover things

### Technology Stack
- **WebXR + Three.js**: Core VR implementation (decided architecture)
- **Blender CLI**: Procedural 3D asset generation 
- **Node.js**: External tools and API integration
- **Docker**: Development environment containerization
- **Steam Web API**: Game library integration

### Next High-Priority Tasks (After WebXR Foundation)

#### Steam Integration Phase (Milestone 4)
**Task 4.1.1.1-4.1.1.4: CORS Proxy Service**
**Status**: 📋 **RESEARCH PHASE**
**Description**: Create lightweight Docker container for Steam Web API access
**Goal**: Enable browser-based Steam library fetching without CORS issues

**Task 3.1.2.2-3.1.2.4: Camera, Movement, and Lighting**
**Status**: 📋 **WAITING**
**Description**: Complete 3D scene foundation before adding VR interactions

### Current Focus Strategy

**PHASE 1: WebXR Foundation (Current)**
1. HTML page with WebXR capability detection ⭐ **NOW**
2. Three.js integration with basic 3D scene
3. Test VR session management (enter/exit)
4. Display simple geometry (cube) for testing

**PHASE 2: Asset Integration**
1. Load Blender GLTF shelf models
2. Implement camera controls and movement
3. Configure lighting system
4. Test across desktop and VR browsers

**PHASE 3: VR Interaction**
1. Enable WebXR controller input
2. Add hand tracking and raycasting
3. Implement grab/touch interactions
4. Optimize for VR performance (90fps)

**PHASE 4: Steam Integration** 
1. Create CORS proxy service
2. Fetch Steam library data
3. Generate game objects from library
4. Implement game launching

**Rationale**: Progressive implementation allows testing at each stage. WebXR foundation must be solid before adding Steam complexity.
