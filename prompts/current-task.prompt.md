## Task Completion Workflow

### How to Approach Current Task (4.3.1.2)
1. **Review existing Steam API client** (`client/src/steam/SteamApiClient.ts`)
2. **Design UI components** for Steam account input and feedback
3. **Implement HTML form elements** in WebXR overlay or scene
4. **Add event handlers** connecting UI to Steam API client
5. **Test complete user workflow** with real Steam accounts
6. **Integrate with 3D scene** to populate game data

### Testing Strategy
- Use `yarn test` for running test suite (now without watch mode)
- Use `yarn serve` for development server
- Test Steam API integration in browser with DevTools
- Use `scripts/test-steam-api-live.sh` if infrastructure verification needed
- Test with real Steam account (SpiteMonger) for validation

### Success Criteria for 4.3.1.2
- [ ] Steam account input UI created and styled
- [ ] Loading states implemented for API calls
- [ ] Error handling UI for invalid/missing accounts
- [ ] Success feedback showing resolved Steam ID and game count
- [ ] Complete user workflow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Ready for 3D scene integration with real Steam data

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Run all tests (now without watch mode)
cd client && yarn test

# Start WebXR client development
cd client && yarn serve

# Build and test client
cd client && yarn build

# Test Steam API infrastructure (if needed)
cd scripts && ./test-steam-api-live.sh

# Generate fresh 3D assets
docker compose run blender blender --background --python blender/gen_shelf_modular.py
```

**Remember**: Steam API client is working and tested! Focus on creating an intuitive UI for users to input their Steam accounts and see their game libraries in the 3D scene.
