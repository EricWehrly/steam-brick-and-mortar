# Terraform Infrastructure Progress Log

## Current Status: Data Source Discovery Phase

### What We're Doing Right Now

We're implementing Task 4.1.1.2 (Implement Terraform modules) for the Steam API Lambda proxy infrastructure. We're taking an incremental, test-driven approach to ensure each step works before building on it.

### Phase 1: Data Source Discovery (Current)

**Goal**: Verify we can successfully discover existing AWS resources before attempting to create new ones.

**Approach**: Create minimal Terraform configuration that only performs data lookups, no resource creation.

**What We're Testing**:
- Route 53 hosted zone discovery for `wehrly.com`
- Existing wildcard SSL certificate discovery (`*.wehrly.com`)
- Validate these resources exist and are accessible

**Results So Far**:
- ✅ **Route 53 Zone Found**: `wehrly.com` (Zone ID: `Z338L3MCT403SF`)
- ✅ **Wildcard Certificate Found**: `*.wehrly.com` (ARN: `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:428933486948:certificate/1f1c2305-429b-4889-8b08-77ce681f18b1`)
- ✅ **Terraform Plan Successful**: No errors in data source discovery

**Phase 1 Results**:
1. ✅ `terraform apply` completed successfully - outputs work perfectly
2. ✅ Discovered resources match expectations exactly
3. ✅ Committed minimal test configuration as baseline (commit: feat: terraform data source discovery baseline)
4. ✅ No issues found - plan and apply results identical

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Certificate Management**: We will NOT create or manage SSL certificates. We'll use the existing wildcard certificate for `*.wehrly.com`.
2. **Domain Approach**: We're "hijacking" an existing domain for development purposes, not legitimizing this as a permanent subdomain.
3. **Incremental Commits**: Each working phase gets its own commit to maintain project stability.
4. **Test-First**: Validate data sources before building dependent resources.

### Phase 2: Lambda Module Development (Current)

**Goal**: Create and test Lambda function locally before AWS deployment.

**Approach**: 
1. Local testing of Lambda code with mock events
2. Create minimal Lambda Terraform module
3. Test module with terraform plan (no apply yet)
4. Incremental commit of working Lambda module

**Steps**:
1. ✅ **Complete**: Set up local Lambda testing environment with Yarn
2. ✅ **Complete**: Test Lambda code with mock API Gateway events - PASSED!
3. 🚧 **Current**: Create minimal Lambda Terraform module
4. ⏳ **Next**: Test Lambda module with terraform plan

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Health endpoint: 200 OK with proper CORS headers
- ✅ Error handling: Graceful failures when Steam API key missing (expected)
- ✅ Response structure: Correct JSON responses
- ✅ CORS configuration: Working properly

**Package Manager**: Using Yarn consistently (not npm) across all Node.js components.

### Files Created So Far

```
external-tool/infrastructure/
├── test-data-sources.tf    # Minimal test configuration (data sources only)
├── test.tfvars            # Test variables with real domain
├── .gitignore             # Terraform-specific ignores
├── versions.tf            # Provider requirements
└── modules/               # Module structure (created but not yet used)
    ├── lambda/
    ├── api-gateway/
    └── domain/
```

### Commands Run

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Test data source discovery
terraform plan -var-file="test.tfvars"

# Next: Apply to confirm outputs
terraform apply -var-file="test.tfvars" -auto-approve
```

### Issues to Watch For

1. **Multiple Route 53 Zones**: There are 2 public hosted zones for `wehrly.com`. We're using the one with more records (Z338L3MCT403SF).
2. **Certificate Region**: SSL certificates for API Gateway must be in `us-east-1`.
3. **CORS Configuration**: Will need to be tested with actual WebXR client.

### Commit Strategy

Each phase gets its own commit:
- Commit 1: Data source discovery test (current)
- Commit 2: Lambda module
- Commit 3: API Gateway module
- Commit 4: Domain integration
- Commit 5: Secrets management
- Commit 6: Full integration

This ensures we can roll back to any working state if issues arise.
