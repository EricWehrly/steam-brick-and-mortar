# Terraform Infrastructure Progress Log

## Current Status: Data Source Discovery Phase

### What We're Doing Right Now

We're implementing Task 4.1.1.2 (Implement Terraform modules) for the Steam API Lambda proxy infrastructure. We're taking an incremental, test-driven approach to ensure each step works before building on it.

### Phase 1: Data Source Discovery (Current)

**Goal**: Verify we can successfully discover existing AWS resources before attempting to create new ones.

**Approach**: Create minimal Terraform configuration that only performs data lookups, no resource creation.

**What We're Testing**:
- Route 53 hosted zone discovery for `wehrly.com`
- Existing wildcard SSL certificate discovery (`*.wehrly.com`)
- Validate these resources exist and are accessible

**Results So Far**:
- ✅ **Route 53 Zone Found**: `wehrly.com` (Zone ID: `Z338L3MCT403SF`)
- ✅ **Wildcard Certificate Found**: `*.wehrly.com` (ARN: `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:428933486948:certificate/1f1c2305-429b-4889-8b08-77ce681f18b1`)
- ✅ **Terraform Plan Successful**: No errors in data source discovery

**Next Steps in This Phase**:
1. Run `terraform apply` to confirm outputs work in practice
2. Verify the discovered resources match expectations
3. Commit this minimal test configuration as baseline
4. Document any issues found during apply vs plan

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Certificate Management**: We will NOT create or manage SSL certificates. We'll use the existing wildcard certificate for `*.wehrly.com`.
2. **Domain Approach**: We're "hijacking" an existing domain for development purposes, not legitimizing this as a permanent subdomain.
3. **Incremental Commits**: Each working phase gets its own commit to maintain project stability.
4. **Test-First**: Validate data sources before building dependent resources.

### Phase 2: Planned Next Steps

1. **Lambda Module**: Create basic Lambda function (no secrets yet)
2. **API Gateway Module**: Create API Gateway that routes to Lambda
3. **Domain Integration**: Connect API Gateway to existing certificate and Route 53
4. **Secrets Management**: Add Steam API key via Secrets Manager
5. **Full Integration**: Complete end-to-end testing

### Files Created So Far

```
external-tool/infrastructure/
├── test-data-sources.tf    # Minimal test configuration (data sources only)
├── test.tfvars            # Test variables with real domain
├── .gitignore             # Terraform-specific ignores
├── versions.tf            # Provider requirements
└── modules/               # Module structure (created but not yet used)
    ├── lambda/
    ├── api-gateway/
    └── domain/
```

### Commands Run

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Test data source discovery
terraform plan -var-file="test.tfvars"

# Next: Apply to confirm outputs
terraform apply -var-file="test.tfvars" -auto-approve
```

### Issues to Watch For

1. **Multiple Route 53 Zones**: There are 2 public hosted zones for `wehrly.com`. We're using the one with more records (Z338L3MCT403SF).
2. **Certificate Region**: SSL certificates for API Gateway must be in `us-east-1`.
3. **CORS Configuration**: Will need to be tested with actual WebXR client.

### Commit Strategy

Each phase gets its own commit:
- Commit 1: Data source discovery test (current)
- Commit 2: Lambda module
- Commit 3: API Gateway module
- Commit 4: Domain integration
- Commit 5: Secrets management
- Commit 6: Full integration

This ensures we can roll back to any working state if issues arise.
