## Research Objective
Determine the best approach for retrieving a user's Steam game library from a browser-based WebXR application, including authentication strategies and technical implementation options.

## Steam Web API Overview

### API Base URL
- **Production**: `https://api.steampowered.com/`
- **Documentation**: https://steamcommunity.com/dev
- **Developer Portal**: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

## Game Library Retrieval

### Primary API Endpoint: GetOwnedGames
**Endpoint**: `IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames/v0001/`
**Purpose**: Retrieve list of games owned by a Steam user

**Request Parameters**:
- `key` (string, required): Steam Web API key
- `steamid` (uint64, required): 64-bit Steam ID of user
- `format` (string, optional): Response format (json, xml, vdf) - default: json

{
  "response": {
    "game_count": 123,
    "games": [
      {
        "appid": 440,
        "name": "Team Fortress 2",
        "playtime_forever": 8643,
        "img_icon_url": "e3f595a92552da3d664ad00277fad2107345f743",
        "img_logo_url": "07385eb55b5ba974aebbe74d3c99626bda7920b8",
        "playtime_windows_forever": 8643,
        "playtime_mac_forever": 0,
        "playtime_linux_forever": 0,
        "has_community_visible_stats": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Key Data Points Available:
- ‚úÖ **App ID**: Unique game identifier
- ‚úÖ **Game Name**: Display name for our 3D boxes
- ‚úÖ **Icon URL**: Small game icon (32x32)
- ‚úÖ **Logo URL**: Game logo image
- ‚úÖ **Playtime**: Total hours played
- ‚ùå **Box Art**: NOT included - need separate approach

## Game Artwork & Assets

### Steam Store Assets
Game artwork is available via Steam's CDN with predictable URLs:

**Header Images (460x215)**:
```
https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/{APPID}/header.jpg
```

**Capsule Images (231x87)**:
```
https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/{APPID}/capsule_231x231.jpg
```

**Library Assets (600x900) - PERFECT FOR GAME BOXES**:
```
https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/{APPID}/library_600x900.jpg
```

**Icons (32x32)**:
```
https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/{APPID}/{ICON_HASH}.jpg
```

### üéØ **Optimal Strategy for Game Boxes**:
Use `library_600x900.jpg` images - these are the tall, narrow images perfect for game case spines!

## Authentication Challenges

### Steam Web API Key Requirements
- **Acquisition**: Must register at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
- **Domain Restriction**: API keys can be restricted to specific domains
- **Rate Limiting**: 100,000 requests per day per key
- **Public Exposure Risk**: Cannot safely expose API key in client-side code

### Steam ID Discovery
**Problem**: How does a user provide their Steam ID?

**Options**:
1. **Manual Entry**: User enters their 64-bit Steam ID
2. **Steam Profile URL**: Parse from profile URLs like `steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960434622`
3. **Custom URL**: Handle vanity URLs like `steamcommunity.com/id/gabelogannewell`
4. **Steam OpenID**: Full OAuth-like authentication flow

### Vanity URL Resolution
**Endpoint**: `ISteamUser/ResolveVanityURL/v0001/`
**Purpose**: Convert custom URLs to Steam IDs

```
https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/ResolveVanityURL/v1/?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&vanityurl=gabelogannewell
```

## Browser Implementation Challenges

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
**Problem**: Steam Web API does not include CORS headers
**Result**: Direct browser requests to Steam API will be blocked

**Error Example**:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://api.steampowered.com/...' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present
```

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Exposure**: Cannot include Steam API key in client-side JavaScript
- **Rate Limiting**: All requests appear to come from single IP if proxied
- **User Privacy**: Steam IDs can be sensitive information

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: CORS Proxy Server ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED BY DOMAIN REQUIREMENT**
**Architecture**: Node.js proxy between client and Steam API

**CRITICAL BARRIER**: Steam API key registration requires a domain name, which adds significant deployment complexity.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Hides API key from client
- ‚úÖ Handles CORS headers
- ‚úÖ Can implement caching

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå **REQUIRES DOMAIN**: Steam API key registration needs domain verification
- ‚ùå Requires server infrastructure and hosting
- ‚ùå Additional complexity for users
- ‚ùå Potential single point of failure

### Strategy 2: Steam Profile Web Scraping ü§î **POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE**
**Architecture**: Parse public Steam profile pages directly

**How it works**:
- Steam profiles have public game lists: `https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/{STEAMID}/games/?tab=all`
- Or: `https://steamcommunity.com/id/{CUSTOMURL}/games/?tab=all`
- Parse HTML/JSON data from public profile pages
- Extract game names and IDs without API

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ No API key required
- ‚úÖ Works for public profiles
- ‚úÖ Can be done client-side with CORS proxy or server-side
- ‚úÖ Steam artwork URLs still work with app IDs

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Only works for public profiles
- ‚ùå Fragile - breaks if Steam changes page structure
- ‚ùå Rate limiting concerns
- ‚ùå Still has CORS issues for direct browser access

**Example URL**:
```
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960287930/games/?tab=all&xml=1
```

### Strategy 3: Local Steam Client Integration üéØ **MOST PROMISING**
**Architecture**: Read Steam data directly from local Steam installation

**How it works**:
- Steam stores library data locally in `config/loginusers.vdf` and `userdata/` folders
- Parse VDF (Valve Data Format) files directly
- Use Electron or desktop app to access local file system
- No network requests needed!

**Local Steam Paths**:
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\{USERID}\config\localconfig.vdf`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/userdata/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Steam/userdata/`

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **NO API KEY NEEDED**
- ‚úÖ **NO DOMAIN REQUIRED**
- ‚úÖ Instant access to full library
- ‚úÖ Works offline
- ‚úÖ No rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Can get playtime and other detailed stats

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Requires desktop app (Electron)
- ‚ùå Not pure web solution
- ‚ùå Needs file system access permissions
- ‚ùå Requires Steam to be installed locally

### Strategy 4: Manual Library Input üìù **SIMPLE FALLBACK**
**Architecture**: User manually inputs their Steam games

**How it works**:
- Simple UI for users to add games manually
- Autocomplete using Steam store search
- Save library data locally
- Still use Steam artwork URLs with app IDs

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **NO API BARRIERS**
- ‚úÖ Works in any browser
- ‚úÖ No authentication needed
- ‚úÖ User has full control

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Manual effort required
- ‚ùå Not automated
- ‚ùå Doesn't scale for large libraries
- ‚ùå User has to maintain their own list

### Strategy 5: Steam Profile URL Parsing üîç **HYBRID APPROACH**
**Architecture**: Combine profile scraping with manual fallbacks

**How it works**:
1. User provides Steam profile URL
2. Attempt to parse public game list from profile
3. Fall back to manual entry for private profiles
4. Cache successful results

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **NO API KEY NEEDED**
- ‚úÖ Works for many users with public profiles
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation to manual entry
- ‚úÖ Still gets Steam artwork

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Limited to public profiles
- ‚ùå Still has web scraping fragility

## Recommended Implementation Plan - REVISED
