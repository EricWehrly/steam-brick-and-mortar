## Project Overview

**Current Architecture**: WebXR-first with progressive enhancement (see `docs/webxr-architecture.md`)  
**Research Status**: Complete (archived in `docs/research-archive.md`)  
**Current Phase**: UI consolidation and pause menu system  
**Current Task**: [Pause Menu Feature Implementation](./pause-menu-feature-plan.md)

## Three-Phase Development Strategy

### **Phase 1: "Ready for Me"** ðŸš§ **CURRENT FOCUS**
*Goal: Demonstrate all imagined functionality with competency - personal demo-ready*

**Scope**: Complete through Milestone 6 (Level Layout)
- âœ… Foundation & Development Environment (Milestone 1)
- âœ… 3D Asset Generation (Milestone 2) 
- âœ… 3D Scene Foundation (Milestone 3)
- âœ… Steam API Research & Integration (Milestone 4)
- âœ… Game Art & Visual Integration (Milestone 5) - **COMPLETED**
- ðŸ”„ **Pause Menu & UI Consolidation** - **CURRENT TASK**
- ðŸ”„ Level Layout and Spatial Design (Milestone 6) - **NEXT**

**Major Achievements**:
- Complete IndexedDB image caching system with 24-hour expiration
- Progressive artwork loading integrated with Steam game processing
- Cache management UI with quota monitoring and controls
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive test suite covering all caching functionality

**Acceptable Limitations**:
- Small library demos (5-20 games) acceptable
- Rate limiting acceptable for single-user testing
- Basic error handling sufficient

**See**: [`docs/roadmap-phase1-ready-for-me.md`](./roadmap-phase1-ready-for-me.md)

### **Phase 2: "Ready for Friends"** ðŸ”® **POST-GRAPHICS**
*Goal: Works for people standing next to you during conversation*

**Scope**: Infrastructure hardening and multi-user capability
- Robust rate limiting and error handling for Steam API constraints
- Infrastructure hardening for 20 req/min per IP limits  
- Caching strategy implementation to handle 800+ game libraries
- Multi-user testing capability
- Input Systems and User Controls (Milestone 7)
  - Enhanced camera controls with configurable roll system
  - Movement acceleration and speed customization
  - Camera reset and player positioning features
- User Experience Options (Milestone 8)

**Key Requirements**:
- Handle 800+ game libraries efficiently (120+ minute loading without caching)
- AWS Lambda IP pool analysis and mitigation
- Comprehensive caching infrastructure (browser + cloud)
- Error recovery and graceful degradation

**See**: [`docs/roadmap-phase2-ready-for-friends.md`](./roadmap-phase2-ready-for-friends.md)

### **Phase 3: "Ready for Everyone"** ðŸ”® **PRE-PUBLIC**  
*Goal: Public release readiness with compliance and scalability*

**Scope**: Compliance, legal, and production scalability
- Privacy policy and Steam API compliance research
- Production-grade infrastructure scaling
- Public traffic handling and abuse mitigation
- Legal compliance and user data handling

**Key Requirements**:
- Steam API terms of service compliance
- Privacy policy creation and user consent flows
- Production infrastructure scaling
- Public traffic abuse mitigation

**See**: [`docs/roadmap-phase3-ready-for-everyone.md`](./roadmap-phase3-ready-for-everyone.md)

## Task Management

**Current Task Prompt**: See `prompts/current-task.prompt.md` for detailed context on what to work on next.

**Task Completion Workflow**:
1. Read `prompts/current-task.prompt.md` for current context and priorities
2. Complete the specified task with testing and validation
3. Update both `prompts/current-task.prompt.md` and the appropriate phase roadmap file with âœ… completion markers
4. Update the current task prompt with the next priority task
5. Commit changes with clear description of what was accomplished

**Progress Tracking**: 
- **Tasks**: Smallest unit of work that can be committed without breaking the build
- **Stories**: Smallest grouping of acceptance criteria intended to ship together
- **Milestones**: User-noticeable functionality groupings

**Roadmap Order = Working Priority**: For our two-person team, the order in each phase roadmap reflects the actual working priority. No additional priority labels needed.

## Current Status

**Active Phase**: Phase 1 - "Ready for Me"  
**Current Milestone**: Milestone 5 - Game Art & Visual Integration  
**Current Feature**: Feature 5.5 - Enhanced Game Library Caching & UI  
**Next Task**: Implementation of remaining Feature 5.5 stories

**Recent Completions**:
- âœ… CDN Access Strategy Research (Task 5.1.1.1) - Delivered `docs/cdn-access-strategy.md`
- âœ… Comprehensive Steam API integration with caching and offline capability
- âœ… Progressive game loading with rate limiting (4 games/second)
- âœ… Feature 5.5 Analysis - Confirmed excellent cache infrastructure, identified missing UI enhancements

**Phase 1 Completion**: ~80% complete - solid foundation, working Steam integration with excellent caching, need UI enhancements and level layout
