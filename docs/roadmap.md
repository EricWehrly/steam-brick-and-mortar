#### Story 4.3.4: Restore Offline Steam Data Support ðŸ”„ **DEFERRED**
Note: This may be redundant to 4.3.2.4 and should be re-evaluated when we reach here, it may not be needed.
- **Task 4.3.4.1**: Implement offline mode for cached Steam data
  - Add `hasOfflineData()` method to check for cached user data
  - Implement `loadFromCache()` to start with cached Steam games without network calls
  - Update UI to show "Use Offline Data" button when cached data is available
  - Add offline indicators in the UI when running in offline mode
- **Task 4.3.4.2**: Enhanced cache management features
  - Restore cache statistics tracking (hits/misses counters)
  - Add cache aging/expiration indicators in UI
  - Implement selective cache invalidation by user

**Context**: During the modular refactor, offline mode functionality was simplified and removed from main.ts
**Current State**: 
- Basic caching works for API calls and persists to localStorage
- UI buttons exist but show "not available in simplified client" messages
- Cache stats show only total entries (hits/misses tracking removed)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Users can work entirely offline if they've previously loaded Steam data
- Clear indicators when offline vs online modes are active
- Advanced cache management for power users

#### Future Roadmap: Test Suite Optimization (Post-MVP)
- **Task**: More aggressive test suite reorganization and deduplication
  - Further thin out live tests to single tests per major feature
  - Maximize use of mocks in integration tests  
  - Evaluate test redundancy and consolidate similar test patterns
  - Performance optimization of test suite runtime
  - **Priority**: Low (after main features are complete)
