## Notes

### Critical Decision Point: Blender vs Three.js
This phase depends heavily on the shelf generation research outcome. The decision will impact:
- **Development workflow**: Blender iteration vs JavaScript iteration
- **Asset pipeline**: GLTF loading vs procedural generation
- **Material consistency**: Ensuring same material system throughout
- **Performance**: Different optimization approaches

### Texture Performance Considerations
VR texture requirements are more demanding than desktop:
- **Resolution**: Balance visual quality vs performance
- **Compression**: Use appropriate formats for WebXR
- **Memory**: Manage texture memory for longer VR sessions
- **Streaming**: Consider progressive texture loading

### LOD Planning
Begin implementing "dummy" objects for distant props:
- **Simple geometry**: Basic shapes for background elements
- **Texture switching**: Lower resolution textures for distant objects
- **Visibility culling**: Remove objects outside VR view frustum
