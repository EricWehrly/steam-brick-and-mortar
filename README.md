# SteamVR Blockbuster Shelf

Recreate the nostalgic Blockbuster browsing experience in VR with your Steam library. Procedurally generates 3D shelves and creates an interactive SteamVR environment where you can physically browse and launch your games.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate a shelf model (outputs to steamvr-addon/models/)
docker compose run blender blender --background --python blender/gen_shelf_modular.py

# Future: Full pipeline with Steam integration
STEAM_API_KEY=your_key_here docker compose run build
```

**Outputs**: 3D models in `steamvr-addon/models/` (FBX, GLTF formats for SteamVR Workshop Tools)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision

Transform your Steam library into a virtual "Blockbuster" experience:
- **Procedurally generated shelves** with realistic wood textures and bracket supports
- **Dynamic game covers** fetched from Steam API and displayed as physical game boxes
- **VR interaction** - reach out and grab games to launch them
- **Nostalgic atmosphere** with appropriate lighting, sounds, and store ambiance

*Yes, this is totally a lark - but imagine walking through aisles of your games like the old days!* ðŸ“¼

## Technologies

- **Blender CLI** - Automated 3D model generation via Python scripts
- **SteamVR Home** - VR environment with custom scripting capabilities  
- **Steam Web API** - Fetches your game library and metadata
- **Docker** - Containerized development environment
- **VScript (Lua)** - SteamVR's scripting language for interactions

## Current Status

**âœ… Working**: Modular 3D shelf generation, Docker workflow, FBX/GLTF export  
**ðŸ”§ In Progress**: Bracket positioning refinements, material system  
**ðŸ“‹ Planned**: Steam API integration, VScript development, texture generation

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Steam account (for API testing)

### Available Commands
```bash
# Generate shelf models
docker compose run blender blender --background --python blender/gen_shelf_modular.py

# Future services
docker compose run nodejs npm install
docker compose run python python external-tool/process_covers.py
```

## Design Specifications

**Current Shelf Design**:
- Main Shelf: Gray wood-style, 2.0Ã—0.6Ã—0.1 units
- Backing: Dark beige pegboard, 2.2Ã—1.5Ã—0.02 units  
- Crown: Gray decorative molding, centered on backing
- Brackets: Gray triangular supports, positioned below shelf

**Colors**: Shelf/Crown/Brackets use gray tones, Backing uses darkish beige

## Core Workflow (Planned)

1. External tool fetches Steam library via Web API
2. Downloads game icons/assets 
3. Generates JSON manifest with game data
4. Blender script creates shelf models procedurally
5. VScript reads JSON, spawns interactive game props in VR
6. Watcher daemon monitors for launch signals

## Future Vision

Recreate the tactile browsing experience of physical media:
- Walk through aisles of your games
- Pick up and examine game covers  
- Discover forgotten games in your library
- Share your virtual store with friends
- Customize shelf layouts and store themes

*Building the future of game library browsing, one shelf at a time.* ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ®
